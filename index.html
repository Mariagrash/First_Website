      <p> “Memories is the diary that we all carry about with us.”
        We always have our memory in our pockets and it would leave a smile on our face every time we remember it – but
        imagine a life without memories to recall? Wouldn’t
        it be very depressing and very boring? Memories are very essential in our lives because they allow us to grow
        and learn to be a better person. Our recollections can teach us very important life lessons,
        demonstrate skills and abilities and can make us feel happy and entertained. There are so much more things that
        our memories can do and how beneficial it is in our lives.
        Our memories are very essential because it teach us very important life lessons
        that we can use and apply in the future. By having memories,
        we will know what is right and what is wrong. We can remember where we did our mistakes and learn from it.
        Time would pass by, responsibilities would build up – that is why memory is very important in our lives.
        From what we have learned, we can be able to apply it further in life.</p>

            <h1>Why saving memories Important?</h1>
            <p>We hold onto past memories, all memories because they mean something to us. Whether good or bad, they're
              a part of us, and a part of the learning experience we carry with us. Of course there are going to be
              positive and negative effects, depending on the memory.

              We want to hold on to those that are positive and those that remind us of the people we love. The good
              times we've had, those times in our lives that brought us happiness. Memories trigger nastalgia of times
              that have passed.

              We also be​ar the memories of times that weren't so pleasant and that were perhaps even painful or
              traumatizing for us, yet we remember. Although these can effect us in negative ways, they may serve a
              purpose in teaching us caution, teaching us lessons, while helping us to grow..

              Memories can bring us to laughter or bring us to tears. They can be our guide, give us strength, or be
              our
              cause to stumble. But they belong to us and they are part of our identity; where we've been, where we're
              going and who we are.</p>
